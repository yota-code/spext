This page exposes quickly the principle of this documentation system. But you can also try to edit it and preview the impacts of your modifications, by clicking on the '<edit> icon on the top right corner.

Not everything is perfect here, lot of work is in progress, don't mind the glitches.

The idea behind '<spext> is to offer a way to store, edit and handle a textual specification which is compatible with the following objectives :

* the document should be easily versionnable with usual VCS tools (ie. git). The format should be plain enough to be easy to merge and diff directly. A file based organisation was proposed, with a syntax close to markdown (but not markdown)
* the document should make it easy to track parts of the text. For this, a chapter / paragraph / alinea structure is proposed and allow fine grained traceability (here in red / green / blue respectively)
* the main formatting options should be available with a sleek, non instrusive and expandable markup system:
	* mathematical equations
	* figures
	* tables
	* extract of code
	* etc. to be implemented
* the text marking should be semantic not cosmetic, tags could be expanded but some are already proposed to mark meaningful parts of speech like scade elements: node, const, vars, etc.

Concerning the syntax, I invite you to have a look at all previous chapters which exposes some of it (and to click on the '<debug> button to have a look at the process)

For the server side, an automatic system based on a checksum, automatically regenerate files on-the-fly. And embedded editor is proposed but the original text can also be edited with a text editor.
